    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "* I (Benny) will visit the exam room at around 10:30 to see if there are any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",

    "#### Discussion on the value of the MAE\n",
    "The mean absolute error (MAE) is approximately 1.63, which means that, on average, the model’s predictions deviate from the true values by about 1.6 units. This indicates a moderate prediction error relative to the scale of the target variable (which ranges roughly from 0 to above 20 in the predicted values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because MAE is measured in the same units as the response variable, it is easy to interpret: most predictions are reasonably close to the true values, but there is still noticeable error. The MAE is not excessively large, suggesting that the linear regression captures a substantial part of the underlying relationship, though it is not perfectly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion on the predicted vs. true scatterplot\n",
    "From the residuals vs. predicted values plot, the residuals are centered around zero, which indicates that the model is approximately unbiased on average. However, the spread of the residuals increases for larger predicted values, suggesting heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance). This means the model tends to make larger errors when predicting higher values of the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the presence of some large positive and negative residuals indicates outliers or observations that are not well explained by a linear relationship. The visible structure in the residuals suggests that the linear model may be misspecified and that a more flexible model or additional explanatory variables could improve performance.\n",

That is, the parameter is the exponential of a linear function. The reason we chose this as our parameter, is that it is always positive which is when the Poisson distribution is defined.

    "Hint: when taking the log of the conditional density you will find that the term that contains the $y!$ does not depend on $\\lambda$ and as such does not depend on $\\alpha,\\beta$, it can thus be discarded. This will be essential due to numerical issues with factorials.\n",

    "Of all the variables listed, ofp - number of physician office visits is selected as the target variable. Features ofnp, opp, and opnp are removed as they capture other hospital visits that may be related to the target variable. Training our model on these would result in unwanted leakages that would reduce the models ability to generalise. All other featues are reasonable and will be maintained.\n",
